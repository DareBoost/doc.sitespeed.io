<h3>Output as JUnit XML</h3>
<p>Sitespeed can now output JUnit XML that you can use in your continuous integration tool. With that, you can for every build test your site against 
sitespeed rules! In the  <a href="/documentation/#junit">documentation</a> you will see how to do it for <a href="/documentation/#jenkins">Jenkins</a> & <a href="/documentation/#travis">Travis</a> (Travis don't have full support yet for JUnit XML but you can still make sure that builds get broken if you violate the rules).
</p>
<p>
You can specify your own limits of when you want the tests to fail: for the overall score and the limit individual tests. And you can of course skip tests.
</p>

<h3>Feed sitespeed.io with a list of URL:s instead of crawl a site</h3>
<p>For some sites, crawling the page isn't the best thing, you want to test a couple of the most used pages (some of them longer down in the path tree), that's why you now can supply a list of url:s to sitespeed to test.
</p>
<p>The list is a plain text file with one url on each line. The first url will gave the name of the whole test (= the same as the first url to crawl). The file needs to look like this:
</p>
<pre>
http://peterhedenskog.com/
http://peterhedenskog.com/work/
http://peterhedenskog.com/music/
</pre>
Check the <a href="/documentation/#run">doc</a> for of how to do it. Heads up: The parameter to supply a file is <strong>f</strong> meaning that the old functionality "follow only the oath when crawling" has changed to <strong>c</strong> so please make sure you change that if you use that functionality.

<h3>Small fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Page summary: Show the number of domains used for that page</li>
<li>Page summary: Show the percantage of assets that are cacheable</li>
<li>Page summary: Show the amount of assets that don't have an exipre header (will NOT be cached)</li>	
<li>Page summary: Added new max size of a document for getting a warning, now using stats from HTTPArchive</li>
<li>Page summary & site summary: Removed prime cache values, they wasn't actually always right</li>
<li>Removed Yslow rule <em>ynumreq</em> and created three new ones in order to get clearer JUnit xml result (and also only check for sync js): <em>cssnumreq</em>, <em>cssimagesnumreq</em> & <em>jsnumreq</em></li>
</ul>  


<h3>Bug fix</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If a max age HTTP cache header was missing the cache time, the cache time was set to 0 instead of checking if a Expire header exists.</li>
	<li>If an asset was missing expire headers, it inherited the last one assets with an expire date</li>
</ul>
