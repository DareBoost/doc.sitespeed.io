  <h1>Sitespeed.io 1.8.1 release notes</h1>
</div>

<p>There are three really important bug fixes in the 1.8.1 release, all three are from Yslow</p>

<ul>
<li> Yslow didn't honour max-age before expires (following 1.1 spec), meaning for sites that had different values for max-age & expires (giving different values for proxies using 1.0 & 1.1 reported the expires header as the cache time even when a max-age header existed. </li>

<li>If a CSS file imported other css file with a relative url with the @import directive, that css wasn't fetched by YSlow, meaning the cache time & size wasn√§t fetched. That is nowfixed in Yslow.</li>

<li>There was a mismatch between assets actually fetched by PhantomJS and Yslow, where PhantomJS don't collect all the assets used by the page. The end result was that some assets didn't get the response header, meaning cachetime, size etc was unknown. That has now been fixed in the sitespeed-yslow branch</li>

<li> In the detailed section, the ttfb is seconds, not ms. Thanks Peter van Gils for reporting!</li> 

<p> The new fixes where every asset now is fetched, the favicon is now avaliable, the Yslow rule check favicon is cached. Also the favicon is added to the expire rules</p>
