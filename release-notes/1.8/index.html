  <h1>Sitespeed.io 1.8 release notes</h1>
</div>

<h3>It's all in the (summary) details</h3>
<p>The summary page is based on the <i>summary.xml</i> file. The summary keeps information of all fields you see on the summary page for all the pages that has been tested. For all the metrics you will get the average, median, max, min, standard deviation, variance, 10 percentil, 90 percentil & the 95 percentil! Yes that is alot of difference statistics and it is quite cool!</p>
How do you actually make use of it? Well for example, now you can easily the largest image of your site, check this out (collected from a big video site):
<a href="detailed-summary-large-image.png"><img src="detailed-summary-large-image.png"></a>

<p>You can also use the summary xml file with Jenkins. You can use the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plot+Plugin" target="_blank">Plot plugin</a>, and create graphs betwen your test runs, keep track of what's happening with your site over your development cycle.</p>

<p>There are also some new fields added, that right now only exist in the summary details page and xml. The total size of js/css & images. The full list of the XML-file is here.

<h3>Goodbye average, hello the 90th percentil!</h3>
The summary page used to report average values of all different scores for the pages. That has been changed so median & the 90th percentil is now standard. 

<h3>Preparing for comparing different runs</h3>
<p>
  The report dir name & structure has been changed, to make it easier to compare runs in the future. The old structure was sitespeed-HOST-NOWDATE, now it is HOST/NOWDATE.
</p>

<h3>New rule checking for old versions</h3>
<p>There is a new rule in town, that checks if the latest version is used for a plugin. Right now it only checking that if JQuery is used on the page, the latest 
version is not.</p>

<h3>Images size are important!</h3>

  On the summary page, you can now see the total image size per page (median & 90 percentil values of course)
