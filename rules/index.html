    Sitespeed.io uses rules to decide if a page is optimized for performance. The rules are based on performance best practices, and implemented using the Yslow rule engine. Check out the exact rules used
    <a href="#matrix">here</a>. If you want to see the implementation, look at it <a href="https://github.com/soulgalore/yslow/blob/master/src/common/rulesets/ruleset_sitespeed.js" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <section id="criticalpath">
        <h3>Critical Rendering Path</h3>
        <p>Every request fetched inside of HEAD, will postpone the rendering of the page! Do not load javascript synchronously inside of head, load files from the same domain as the main document (to avoid DNS lookups) and inline CSS for a really fast rendering path. The scoring system for this rule, will give you minus score for synchronously loaded javascript inside of head, CSS files requested inside of head and minus score for every DNS lookup inside of head.</p>

        <p>
          You can read more about the critical rendering path in <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2012/deciphering-the-critical-rendering-path/" target="_blank">this</a> article by Ilya Grigorik and <a href="http://www.phpied.com/css-and-the-critical-path/" target="_blank">this</a> post by Stoyan Stefanov.

     <section id="spof"> 
    <h3>Frontend single point of failure (SPOF)</h3>
    <p>
      A page can be stopped to be loaded in the browser, if a single script, css and in some cases a font couldn't be fetched or loading slow (the white screen of death), and that is something you really want to avoid. Never load 3rd party components inside of head!  One important note, right now this rule treats domain and subdomains as ok, that match the document domain, all other domains is treated as a SPOF. The score is calculated like this: Synchronously loaded javascripts inside of head, hurts you the most, then CSS files inside of head hurts a little less, font face inside of css files further less, and least inline font face files. One rule SPOF rule missing is the IE specific feature, that a font face will be SPOF if a script is requested before the font face file. 
    </p>

    </section>
    <section id="totalrequests"> 
     <h3>Low number of total requests</h3>
    <p>Avoid have too many requests on your page. The more requests, the slower the page will be.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="cssprint">
    <h3 >Do not load specific CSS file for print</h3>
    <p>
      Loading a specific stylesheet for print, can block rendering in your browser (depending on version) and will for almost all browsers, block the onload event to fire (even though the print stylesheet isn't even used). You can read more about it
      <a href="http://www.phpied.com/5-years-later-print-css-still-sucks/" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
  </section>
   <section id="cssinheaddomain">
    <h3>Load CSS in head from document domain</h3>
    <p>
      CSS files in HEAD, should be loaded from the same domain as the main document, in order to avoid DNS lookups. This is extra important for mobile.
    </p>
  </section>

    <section id="syncjsinhead">
    <h3>Never load JS synchronously in head</h3>
    <p>
      Javascript files should never be loaded synchronously in HEAD, because it will block the rendering of the page. Alternative version to <em>yjsbottom</em> rule, that don't seems to work with phantomjs.
    </p>
  </section>
    <section id="avoidfonts">
    <h3>Avoid use of web fonts</h3>
    <p>
      Avoid use of webfonts because they will decrease the performance of the page. Read <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/10/13/font-face-and-performance/">more</a>.
    </p>
</section>
  <section id="expires">
        <h3>Have expire headers for static components</h3>
    <p> This is a modified version of Yslow expire rule, it will look for assets without any expire headers.
 
    </p>
</section>

  <section id="nodnslookupswhenfewrequests">
    <h3>Avoid DNS lookups when the page has few request</h3>
    <p>
      If you have few requests on a page, they should all be on the same domain to avoid DNS lookups, because the lookups will cost much.
    </p>
  </section>

<section id="inlinecsswhenfewrequest">
  <h3>Do not load stylesheet files when the page has few request</h3>
  <p>When a page has few requests (or actually maybe always if you don't have a massive amount of css), it is better to inline the css, to make the page to start render as early as possible.
  </p>
</section>
<section id="textcontent">
  <h3>Have a reasonable percentage of textual content compared to the rest of the page</h3>
  <p>Make sure you don't have too much styling etc that hides the text you want to deliver.
  </p>
</section>

  <section id="3rdpartyasync">
     <h3>Load third party JS asynchronously</h3>
    Always load third party javascript asynchronously. Third parties that will be checked are twitter, facebook, google (api, analytics, ajax), linkedin, disqus, pinterest & jquery. Read more about asynchronously third party scripts 
    <a href="http://www.phpied.com/3PO#async" target="_blank">here</a>. This rule is borrowed from Stoyan Stefanov.
</section>

<section id="yslow">
      <h3>Modified basic YSlow rules</h3>
      <p>
        Sitespeed.io uses about 20 of the basic rules from YSlow (read about them
        <a href="http://yslow.org#web_performance_best_practices_and_rules" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/marcelduran/yslow/wiki/Ruleset-Matrix">here</a>).

<section id="matrix">
  <h3>All the rules</h3>
  <p>Here is a list with all the rules used when analyzing a website and calculating the score. The weight is the rule's importance, meaning the score of a specific rule, will be weighted with the importance, when calculating the overall score.

        <td class="nobreak">
          You may expect a browser to do nothing when it encounters an empty image src. However, it is not the case in most browsers. IE makes a request to the directory in which the page is located; Safari, Chrome, Firefox 3 and earlier make a request to the actual page itself. This behavior could possibly corrupt user data, waste server computing cycles generating a page that will never be viewed, and in the worst case, cripple your servers by sending a large amount of unexpected traffic.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Compress components with gzip</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Compression reduces response times by reducing the size of the HTTP response. Gzip is the most popular and effective compression method currently available and generally reduces the response size by about 70%. Approximately 90% of today's Internet traffic travels through browsers that claim to support gzip.

      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Put CSS at top</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Moving style sheets to the document HEAD element helps pages appear to load quicker since this allows pages to render progressively.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Put JavaScript at bottom</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          JavaScript scripts block parallel downloads; that is, when a script is downloading, the browser will not start any other downloads. To help the page load faster, move scripts to the bottom of the page if they are deferrable.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Avoid CSS expressions</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          CSS expressions (supported in IE beginning with Version 5) are a powerful, and dangerous, way to dynamically set CSS properties. These expressions are evaluated frequently: when the page is rendered and resized, when the page is scrolled, and even when the user moves the mouse over the page. These frequent evaluations degrade the user experience.
        </td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Make JavaScript and CSS external</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Using external JavaScript and CSS files generally produces faster pages because the files are cached by the browser. JavaScript and CSS that are inlined in HTML documents get downloaded each time the HTML document is requested. This reduces the number of HTTP requests but increases the HTML document size. On the other hand, if the JavaScript and CSS are in external files cached by the browser, the HTML document size is reduced without increasing the number of HTTP requests.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Reduce DNS lookups</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          The Domain Name System (DNS) maps hostnames to IP addresses, just like phonebooks map people's names to their phone numbers. When you type URL www.yahoo.com into the browser, the browser contacts a DNS resolver that returns the server's IP address. DNS has a cost; typically it takes 20 to 120 milliseconds for it to look up the IP address for a hostname. The browser cannot download anything from the host until the lookup completes.
        </td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Minify JavaScript and CSS</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Minification removes unnecessary characters from a file to reduce its size, thereby improving load times. When a file is minified, comments and unneeded white space characters (space, newline, and tab) are removed. This improves response time since the size of the download files is reduced.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Avoid URL redirects</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          URL redirects are made using HTTP status codes 301 and 302. They tell the browser to go to another location. Inserting a redirect between the user and the final HTML document delays everything on the page since nothing on the page can be rendered and no components can be downloaded until the HTML document arrives.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Remove duplicate JavaScript and CSS</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Duplicate JavaScript and CSS files hurt performance by creating unnecessary HTTP requests (IE only) and wasted JavaScript execution (IE and Firefox). In IE, if an external script is included twice and is not cacheable, it generates two HTTP requests during page loading. Even if the script is cacheable, extra HTTP requests occur when the user reloads the page. In both IE and Firefox, duplicate JavaScript scripts cause wasted time evaluating the same scripts more than once. This redundant script execution happens regardless of whether the script is cacheable.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Configure entity tags (ETags)</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Entity tags (ETags) are a mechanism web servers and the browser use to determine whether a component in the browser's cache matches one on the origin server. Since ETags are typically constructed using attributes that make them unique to a specific server hosting a site, the tags will not match when a browser gets the original component from one server and later tries to validate that component on a different server.
        </td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Make AJAX cacheable</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          One of AJAX's benefits is it provides instantaneous feedback to the user because it requests information asynchronously from the backend web server. However, using AJAX does not guarantee the user will not wait for the asynchronous JavaScript and XML responses to return. Optimizing AJAX responses is important to improve performance, and making the responses cacheable is the best way to optimize them.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Use GET for AJAX requests</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          When using the XMLHttpRequest object, the browser implements POST in two steps: (1) send the headers, and (2) send the data. It is better to use GET instead of POST since GET sends the headers and the data together (unless there are many cookies). IE's maximum URL length is 2 KB, so if you are sending more than this amount of data you may not be able to use GET.
        </td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Reduce the number of DOM elements</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          A complex page means more bytes to download, and it also means slower DOM access in JavaScript. Reduce the number of DOM elements on the page to improve performance.
        </td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Avoid HTTP 404 (Not Found) error</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Making an HTTP request and receiving a 404 (Not Found) error is expensive and degrades the user experience. Some sites have helpful 404 messages (for example, "Did you mean ...?"), which may assist the user, but server resources are still wasted.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Reduce cookie size</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          HTTP cookies are used for authentication, personalization, and other purposes. Cookie information is exchanged in the HTTP headers between web servers and the browser, so keeping the cookie size small minimizes the impact on response time.
        </td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Use cookie-free domains</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          When the browser requests a static image and sends cookies with the request, the server ignores the cookies. These cookies are unnecessary network traffic. To workaround this problem, make sure that static components are requested with cookie-free requests by creating a subdomain and hosting them there.
        </td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Avoid Alpha Image Loader filter</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          The IE-proprietary Alpha Image Loader filter attempts to fix a problem with semi-transparent true color PNG files in IE versions less than Version 7. However, this filter blocks rendering and freezes the browser while the image is being downloaded. Additionally, it increases memory consumption. The problem is further multiplied because it is applied per element, not per image.
        </td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Do not scale images in HTML</td>
        <td class="nobreak">
          Web page designers sometimes set image dimensions by using the width and height attributes of the HTML image element. Avoid doing this since it can result in images being larger than needed. For example, if your page requires image myimg.jpg which has dimensions 240x720 but displays it with dimensions 120x360 using the width and height attributes, then the browser will download an image that is larger than necessary.

        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="nobreak">Make favicon small and cacheable</td>
	<td class="nobreak">
	  A favicon is an icon associated with a web page; this icon resides in the favicon.ico file in the server's root. Since the browser requests this file, it needs to be present; if it is missing, the browser returns a 404 error (see "Avoid HTTP 404 (Not Found) error" above). Since favicon.ico resides in the server's root, each time the browser requests this file, the cookies for the server's root are sent. Making the favicon small and reducing the cookie size for the server's root cookies improves performance for retrieving the favicon. Making favicon.ico cacheable avoids frequent requests for it.
